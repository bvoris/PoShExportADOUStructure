# PoShExportADOUStructure
I had a project where i needed to replicate the OU structure in a dummy test domain for validation of group policy objects (things like mapped drives/printers for groups) 
<BR />
I created this script to export  the OU structure from our existing AD environment into my lab environment. This can also be done with specific LDAP commands but I wanted to learn how to do it in PowerShell.   Hand script if you ever want to import a replica of your OU structure in a lab environment
